# README-Generator

## Description

This is a professional README generator that allows the user create a README file using the command line. It was done using a module in npm called Inquirer. Also file system in node was also used to write the file. With these tools I was able to create a professional README file which saves the user time as they can dynamically enter all the information they need without having to create a README file.

Here is the link to the walkthrough video: https://youtu.be/D5grR5ra45A

## Usage

To use this, the user should ensure the javasacript file has been opened in integrated terminal as seen below

    ![alt text](starter/images/01.png)

Then type "node (name of javascript file).js" as shown below so the process of creating the README is initialised and the user gets to answer a few prompt questions.

After the prompts are answered, a README file is generated and populated with all the information entered by the user.
